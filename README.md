# KdTree
Implemented KdTree to search the nearest point from the given target point.  
This project is related to the course - Algorithms and data structues in Java. In this project, we were given two additional exercises - spell.java and ArrayST.java. While the project is mainly about searching the nearest neighbour point from the target in the 2d-coordinate axis. We accomplish the goal of finding the nearest neighbour by two ways - brute force and KdTree. 
There is also a attached report which in detail explains what each problems - brute force and KdTree.
